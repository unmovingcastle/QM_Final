\section{The Hydrogen Atom}
Equation [85] on page 149 (third edition) says that the total degeneracy of the energy level $E_n$ is
\begin{equation*}
    d(n) = \sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(2l+1) = n^2
\end{equation*}
It is perhaps worth reviewing some of the high school math if you, like me, have forgotten the arithmetic series formula:
\begin{equation*}
    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... 2n-1 = \frac{[1 + (2n-1)] * n}{2} = n^2
\end{equation*}
since the first term is 1 and the last term is $2n-2+1 = 2n-1$ and there are $n$ terms in total.
